bancor,bnt,Bancor Network Token,ethereum,['ethereum'],0,,"['Decentralized Exchange Token (DEX)', 'Automated Market Maker (AMM)', 'Decentralized Finance (DeFi)', 'Exchange-based Tokens']",,[],"Bancor is a blockchain protocol that allows users to convert between different tokens directly as opposed to exchanging them on cryptocurrency markets. The project offers a network, which we’ll discuss soon, that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges. That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin"">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum"">Ethereum</a> because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.

Bancor’s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn’t call for an exchange of tokens with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain’s protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert back and forth between those reserves as users request it.

The Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer, economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation that’s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network, <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos"">Tezos (XTZ)</a>. 

One of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens’ built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens’ smart contracts always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible for balancing a Smart Token’s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token’s total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios, known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps.""","{'homepage': ['https://www.bancor.network/', '', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://etherscan.io/token/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c', 'https://ethplorer.io/address/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c', 'https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c', '', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['https://blog.bancor.network/', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'Bancor', 'facebook_username': 'bancor', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': 1789222, 'telegram_channel_identifier': 'bancor', 'subreddit_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor', 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts', 'https://github.com/bancorprotocol/contracts_eos'], 'bitbucket': []}}",,2017-06-12,0x1f573d6fb3f13d689ff844b4ce37794d79a7ff1c,85.71,14.29,"{'ico_start_date': '2017-06-12T18:00:00.000Z', 'ico_end_date': '2017-07-15T00:00:00.000Z', 'short_desc': 'Standard for a new generation of cryptocurrencies - Smart Tokens', 'description': 'The Bancor protocol enables built-in price discovery and a liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains.

Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. 

For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.

Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ","{'homepage': ['https://www.curve.fi/', 'https://curve.eth.link/', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://etherscan.io/token/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52', 'https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52', 'https://polygonscan.com/token/0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af', 'https://arbiscan.io/token/0x11cdb42b0eb46d95f990bedd4695a6e3fa034978', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['https://discord.gg/9uEHakc', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'curvefinance', 'facebook_username': '', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': None, 'telegram_channel_identifier': 'curvefi', 'subreddit_url': None, 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract', 'https://github.com/curvefi/curve-vue'], 'bitbucket': []}}",,,0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52,88.18,11.82,98,112,45.594,62.323,10.919,62.799,0.0,[],2021-10-14T06:59:32.566Z,3.06,16346762573,0.07,0.62,,54.01,-94.36764,2020-08-14T04:53:44.010Z,0.331577,817.38002,2020-11-05T13:09:50.181Z,1194275814,10073519460,325404925,3.09,2.66,0.347411,12.82403,11.57041,33.69411,28.92078,35.0464,-1.6551,460.31622,134936728,12.73782,0.347411,-0.1811,12.82403,11.57041,33.69411,28.92078,35.0464,-1.6551,460.31622,134936728,12.73782,1609326826.60642,3303030299.0,391593942.33239216,,176623,0.0,0.0,0,0,14322,191,489,45,27,18,104,12,"{'additions': 0, 'deletions': 0}",0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",14362,,100,0,,,3.06

Developed by the DODO team, Proactive Market Maker (PMM) is an oracle-aided algorithm with an advanced pricing formula that provides contract-fillable liquidity. Traders get lower slippage with PMM than Automated Market Maker (AMM).

PMM leverages price oracles to retrieve accurate market prices of assets as input. It then aims to provide sufficient liquidity near the market price for every asset. The result is that liquidity decreases rapidly when far away from the market price.

They then kicked off their public ICO on February 28, 2018 and by the end of the ICO on March 7, 2018, they had met their goal of $30,000,000 USD. Synthetix was <a href=""https://blog.havven.io/havven-is-transforming-into-synthetix-2fdf727b8892"">rebranded</a> from Havven on November 30, 2018.

Synthetix is led by a multidisciplinary team of 13 individuals. The project was founded by Kain Warwick, who previously co-founded blueshyft, one of the largest digital payment networks in Australia. The CTO is Justin Moses, who also serves as the Director of Engineering at MongoDB. Synthetix aims to address the problem that companies running centralized payment networks such as PayPal, credit card networks, or the SWIFT banking network have “absolute control over the value within the network, so any transaction conducted within them may be blocked or reversed at any time.” According to the Synthetix white paper, “Although this is ostensibly designed to protect users, it introduces systemic risk for all participants. If the network is compromised or its owners cease to behave benevolently, no party can trust that the value in their account is secure or accessible.”

This is theorized to work because anyone who holds SNX tokens in escrow will be incentivized by Synthetix rewards derived from network transaction fees that will be distributed “in proportion with how well each issuer maintains the correct Synths supply.” When a Synthetix escrow user puts their SNX in escrow, USD-stabilized Synths will be automatically put up for sale on a decentralized exchange at a price of $1 USD. To release escrowed SNX, the user must buy back the Synths issued (also at a price of $1 USD) at which point the Synths will be burned. The Synthetix system uses an algorithm to adjust network fees, and therefore dividends, to SNX holders to incentivize (or disincentivize) the holding of SNX in escrow smart contracts, and thus, the creation of Synths. The theory is that this will cause users to mint and burn Synths in the appropriate amount based solely on supply and demand.","{'homepage': ['https://www.synthetix.io/', '', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f', 'https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f', 'https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f', 'https://hecoinfo.com/token/0x777850281719d5a96c29812ab72f822e0e09f3da', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['https://discordapp.com/invite/AEdUHzt', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['https://blog.synthetix.io/', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'synthetix_io', 'facebook_username': '', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': None, 'telegram_channel_identifier': '', 'subreddit_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/', 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix', 'https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix-js'], 'bitbucket': []}}",AU,2018-03-11,0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f,61.54,38.46,"{'ico_start_date': '2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z', 'ico_end_date': '2018-03-07T00:00:00.000Z', 'short_desc': 'Havven is a decentralised payment network and stablecoin.

loopring,lrc,Loopring,ethereum,"['ethereum', 'arbitrum-one']",0,,"['Decentralized Exchange Token (DEX)', 'Decentralized Finance (DeFi)', 'Exchange-based Tokens']",,[],"Loopring is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) solution called zkRollup. It has both Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based and orderbook-based exchanges. 

zkRollup is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that migrates computations off the blockchain. Loopring protocol only uses the underlying Ethereum blockchain as a data layer and a verification layer. As a result, Loopring's throughput is as high as 2,025 trades per second compared to Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second. The result is that the cost per trade settlement is as small as $0.00015.

Loopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. This was not previously possible on any DEX as it was prohibitively slow and expensive. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXs can be commercially viable for the first time. Loopring expects non-custodial exchanges can begin to outcompete and displace many centralized counterparts.","{'homepage': ['https://loopring.org/', '', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://etherscan.io/token/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd', 'https://ethplorer.io/address/0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd', '', '', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['https://medium.com/loopring-protocol', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'loopringorg', 'facebook_username': '', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': None, 'telegram_channel_identifier': 'loopring_en', 'subreddit_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/loopringorg/', 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/Loopring/protocols', 'https://github.com/Loopring/lightcone', 'https://github.com/Loopring/loopr', 'https://github.com/Loopring/protocol2', 'https://github.com/Loopring/relay'], 'bitbucket': []}}",CN,2017-08-01,0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd,77.78,22.22,"{'ico_start_date': '2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z', 'ico_end_date': '2017-08-16T00:00:00.000Z', 'short_desc': 'Decentralized Exchange and Open Protocol', 'description': None, 'links': {}, 'softcap_currency': 'ETH', 'hardcap_currency': 'ETH', 'total_raised_currency': 'USD', 'softcap_amount': '50000.0', 'hardcap_amount': '120000.0', 'total_raised': '45000000.0', 'quote_pre_sale_currency': '', 'base_pre_sale_amount': None, 'quote_pre_sale_amount': None, 'quote_public_sale_currency': 'USD', 'base_public_sale_amount': 1.0, 'quote_public_sale_amount': 0.06, 'accepting_currencies': '', 'country_origin': 'CN', 'pre_sale_start_date': None, 'pre_sale_end_date': None, 'whitelist_url': '', 'whitelist_start_date': None, 'whitelist_end_date': None, 'bounty_detail_url': '', 'amount_for_sale': '13950760545239.0', 'kyc_required': True, 'whitelist_available': None, 'pre_sale_available': None, 'pre_sale_ended': False}",160,65,49.994,67.327,39.194,50.304,0.0,[],2021-10-14T07:11:18.811Z,0.387927,113546100,4.24,4.68,"{'times': 5.465454322350086, 'currency': 'usd', 'percentage': 546.5454322350087}",2.4,-83.93464,2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,0.01963893,1866.7152,2019-12-18T13:14:41.553Z,481489201,531154197,23082835,0.388137,0.364321,0.01988963,5.40424,-1.18334,9.16159,-10.96305,18.79629,-20.3571,104.87959,24296086,5.31418,0.01988963,0.02651,5.40424,-1.18334,9.16159,-10.96305,18.79629,-20.3571,104.87959,24296086,5.31418,1373873440.44246,1374513896.0,1245991468.94246,,98208,0.25,3.333,12883,29,6461,6,25,15,346,342,1218,20,"{'additions': 0, 'deletions': 0}",4,[],195654,,100,,['https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/security_audit/LoopringV3_1_Report_EN.pdf'],"['Chainlink', 'Band']",0.387927

ZKSwap provides zero-gas fee swapping and instantaneous confirmation, solving the scaling issues, with peak TVL over $1 billion. Unlike other layer2 solutions, the withdrawal from ZKSwap to layer1 is also very quick, taking approximately 40 minutes. 

Currently live on Ethereum, ZKSwap will soon be implemented on BSC, HECO and OKEX Chain, #layer2_for_all. ZKSwap V2 is launching soon in June, enabling unlimited listing! After V2, we will launch #layer2_for_all and soon NFT swapping on layer2. 

There are on-going liquidity mining and staking campaigns on ZKSwap, check it out now!
