Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. 

For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.

Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ","{'homepage': ['https://www.curve.fi/', 'https://curve.eth.link/', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://etherscan.io/token/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52', 'https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52', 'https://polygonscan.com/token/0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af', 'https://arbiscan.io/token/0x11cdb42b0eb46d95f990bedd4695a6e3fa034978', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['https://discord.gg/9uEHakc', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'curvefinance', 'facebook_username': '', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': None, 'telegram_channel_identifier': 'curvefi', 'subreddit_url': None, 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/curvefi/curve-contract', 'https://github.com/curvefi/curve-vue'], 'bitbucket': []}}",,,0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52,90.18,9.82,95,112,45.594,62.323,10.919,62.799,0.0,[],2021-10-14T07:54:30.296Z,3.11,16346762573,0.08,0.63,,54.01,-94.22413,2020-08-14T04:53:44.010Z,0.331577,840.75395,2020-11-05T13:09:50.181Z,1227142342,10350292140,342844496,3.14,2.67,0.430617,16.09751,13.36631,35.84613,30.99596,37.22018,-0.07209,469.33537,169482084,16.02425,0.430617,1.83263,16.09751,13.36631,35.84613,30.99596,37.22018,-0.07209,469.33537,169482084,16.02425,1609363051.1581,3303030299.0,391611008.0576522,,176623,0.0,0.0,0,0,14322,191,489,45,27,18,104,12,"{'additions': 0, 'deletions': 0}",0,"[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]",14362,,100,0,,,3.11

Developed by the DODO team, Proactive Market Maker (PMM) is an oracle-aided algorithm with an advanced pricing formula that provides contract-fillable liquidity. Traders get lower slippage with PMM than Automated Market Maker (AMM).

PMM leverages price oracles to retrieve accurate market prices of assets as input. It then aims to provide sufficient liquidity near the market price for every asset. The result is that liquidity decreases rapidly when far away from the market price.

TendieSwap Predictions: A tool which enables you to make money based on where you think certain coins are headed price-wise. So for example if you think BNB is going to be higher than $340 in 5 Minutes then you can bet this and make money off your theory.

TendieSwap Lottery: Spend TENDIE's to buy tickets, contributing to the lottery pot. Win prizes if 2, 3, or 4 of your ticket numbers match the winning numbers and their exact order!

TendieSwap is the new GOAT of Prediction Markets. We will offer an Automated Market Making algorithm that enables users to create automated prediction markets with integrated options & pricing calculation. Later down the road, users will be able to set up their own bets and get others to take the other side; real decentralized betting enabled.","{'homepage': ['https://www.tendieswap.org/', '', ''], 'blockchain_site': ['https://bscscan.com/token/0x9853a30c69474bed37595f9b149ad634b5c323d9', '', '', '', ''], 'official_forum_url': ['', '', ''], 'chat_url': ['', '', ''], 'announcement_url': ['https://tendieswap.medium.com/', ''], 'twitter_screen_name': 'tendie_swap', 'facebook_username': '', 'bitcointalk_thread_identifier': None, 'telegram_channel_identifier': 'tendieswap', 'subreddit_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TendieSwap/', 'repos_url': {'github': ['https://github.com/tendieswap'], 'bitbucket': []}}",,,0x9853a30c69474bed37595f9b149ad634b5c323d9,100.0,0.0,1756,1919,15.918,0.0,23.225,1.0,0.0,[],2021-10-14T07:14:57.679Z,0.427281,385171,5.95,?,,8.32,-94.8616,2021-06-04T02:04:28.447Z,0.357045,19.67162,2021-09-21T23:50:04.759Z,2291819,{},10337.79,0.436176,0.410086,0.00821986,1.96149,-5.48323,-4.4097,-47.0837,-78.9503,0.0,0.0,44373,1.97439,0.00821986,-0.46285,1.96149,-5.48323,-4.4097,-47.0837,-78.9503,{},{},44373,1.97439,5426535.15846607,,5363726.685434358,,1404,0.0,0.0,252,4,2518,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"{'additions': None, 'deletions': None}",0,[],,,2,0,,,0.427281

zkswap,zks,ZKSwap,ethereum,['ethereum'],0,,['Decentralized Exchange Token (DEX)'],,[],"ZKSwap is a layer2 DEX based on the ZK-Rollup technology and using the AMM model. ZKSwap provides zero-gas fee swapping and instantaneous confirmation, solving the scaling issues, with peak TVL over $1 billion. Unlike other layer2 solutions, the withdrawal from ZKSwap to layer1 is also very quick, taking approximately 40 minutes. 

Currently live on Ethereum, ZKSwap will soon be implemented on BSC, HECO and OKEX Chain, #layer2_for_all. ZKSwap V2 is launching soon in June, enabling unlimited listing! After V2, we will launch #layer2_for_all and soon NFT swapping on layer2. 

There are on-going liquidity mining and staking campaigns on ZKSwap, check it out now!
